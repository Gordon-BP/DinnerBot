# DinnerBot
A small chatbot built using BotPress. Asks the user for three ingredients and then gives a recipe that uses them.

All recipes are stored in the ./actions/Recipes.json file. Edit this file to add/remove recipes. Because this is a demonstration bot, only a few recipes are in the database such as:

1. Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich- Bread, Peanut Butter, and Jelly
2. Grilled Cheese Sandwich- Bread, Butter, Cheese
3. Macaroni and Cheese- Macaroni, Cheese, Milk
